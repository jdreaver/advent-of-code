# Advent of Code

Solutions to the Advent of Code problems https://adventofcode.com

I used this to learn Rust. Sometimes I refactored my solution after
completing a problem, but sometimes I was kind of over the problem and
left the code as-is once I got the right answer, so please don't use
this code as any barometer of quality. I just made this repo public so
I could share my solutions with some coworkers.
